### GEM: Intro

GEM is a GUI for creating and managing an Elasticsearch index's datastrcuture mappings. ES Mappings provide an immutable interface to control how data is stored internally within Elasticsearch and how queries can be applied to it.  

Mappings allow deciding things like:

* Should a field with value '2016-12-01' be treated as a `date` or as a `text` field?  
* Should 'San Francisco' be stored as an **analyzed** text field to then run full-text search queries against it, or should it be kept non-analyzed for an aggregations use-case?  
* Should 'loc': ['40.73', '-73.9'] be stored as `Object` or should it have a `geopoint` datatype.  

**GEM** takes this a step further by providing an on-the-fly mapping inference based on user provided input data.

### Features

GEM supports three key mapping related options today:  

1. **Create data mappings** with an on-the-fly auto inferencing capability.  
2. **Managing all the current data mappings** with an option to see the raw JSON data.

3. **Importing new data analyzers** to be later associated with field mappings.

GEM keeps the entire app state in the URL which makes for easy sharing of views.   And most importantly, GEM is entirely built on the client side and is available as a github hosted app.

### Mapping and GEM FAQs

#### What is a mapping?

#### How to create a new mapping?

#### What are the available mapping types?

#### Can a mapping be modified once it is applied?

#### How to map a sub field?

#### What is an analyzer?

#### How to create a custom analyzer?

#### How to share a GEM view externally?


### Build Locally

``dev`` branch is the bleeding edge version of gem, all new changes go here.

``gh-pages`` branch is for the Github Pages hosted version of the app, it is just the stable version of the `dev` branch.

``master`` branch is more suitable for installing gem locally. The Elasticsearch site plugin for gem uses ``master`` branch.

``chrome-extension`` branch is for publishing the chrome extension.  

#### Local Installation

1. git clone https://github.com/appbaseio/gem
2. git checkout master
3. npm install
4. bower install
5. npm start (runs gem on http://localhost:8000)

And build with  

```sh
$ npm run build
```

#### Contributing

The source code is in the `app` directory. Pull requests should be created against the ``dev`` branch.


### Get GEM

GEM is available as a hosted app and as a chrome extension.

#### [Use hosted app](http://appbaseio.github.io/gem)  

or  

#### [Get the Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gem/enmjddbghmojhlldblbblolfljndkkjn)

or

#### Install As Elasticsearch Plugin

``bin/plugin install appbaseio/gem``

``Note``: To make sure you enable CORS settings for your ElasticSearch instance, add the following lines in the ES configuration file.

```sh
 http.port: 9200
 http.cors.allow-origin: "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
 http.cors.enabled: true
 http.cors.allow-headers : X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type, Content-Length, Authorization
 http.cors.allow-credentials: true
```

After installing the plugin, 
start elasticsearch service 
```sh
elasticsearch
```
and visit the following URL to access it.

```sh 
http://127.0.0.1:9200/_plugin/gem 
```

``Note:`` If you use Elasticsearch from a different port, the URL to access and the `http.cors.allow-origin` value in the configuration file would change accordingly.

### Other Apps

Just like GEM is purpose built for the mapping needs of an Elasticsearch indexes,  
**[dejavu](http://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/)** is purpose built for viewing your Elasticsearch index's data and perform CRUD operations, 
**[mirage](http://opensource.appbase.io/mirage/)** is purpose built for composing queries with a GUI.

Together, these three apps form a good base for building a great search experience.
